== Description ==

Allows you to use a shortcode instead of HTML code to output an icon font, specifically for Font Awesome. Example usage: [i]icon-bolt icon-border[/i]

Requires both opening <strong>[i]</strong> and closing <strong>[/i]</strong>, just like most WordPress shortcodes.

With this shortcode plugin, you can maximize your usage of icon fonts, which are infinitely scalable and perfect on retina displays.
<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">&raquo; No more switching between Visual Editor and Text/HTML Editor
<br />&raquo; Actually see where in your content you put the icons, since the non-shortcode version doesn't show up in Visual Editor
<br />&raquo; Change the color or font-size of any icon
<br />&raquo; Turn any icon into a link
<br />&raquo; Supports all <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/" target="_blank">Font Awesome icons</a>
<br />&raquo; Over a dozen built-in styles: invert colors, opacity/transparency, drop shadow, outline/stroke, even rotate the icons! Also background color, rounded corners background, circle background.
<br />&raquo; Further customize yourself with CSS ID and class selectors.
<br />&raquo; Use icon font icons for your site-wide bullets!
