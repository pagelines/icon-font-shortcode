== Changelog ==

== 1.0.2013.02.17.00 ==
* Added more built-in stylings: inverse coloring, outlining (only works on webkit browsers), and glossy effect
== 1.0.2013.02.16.00 ==
* Deleted minified LESS file since LESS minifies anyways and because minified LESS didn't allow the LESS gradient mixin to work (maybe because of the minifyer that I used, who cares, deleted). Updated PHP file to reference .less instead of .min.less.
